# Getting Started with Logism 

Logism is a simulation environment that can be used by students to get the hang of circuit design. 
It's simplicity helps you get the hang of the stuff very quick
At the same time, when you reach more advanced circuits, constrainsts of logism start popping up.

## Why to learn logism


It is the least inertial method of circuit design. You can start designing beautiful circuits from day 1. Without worrying about chip names, which manufacturer, or any of the complex stuff. 


## Installation Link


[download logism for windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/)


## The first screen that opens


![empty logism screen](https://github.com/ninja3011/logismtutorial/blob/gh-pages/ltut1.PNG)

- On the left, a tab holds all the parts available to create a circuit in logism.
- On the right, there is an empty workspace to work with. You can drag and drop components here
- On the the top are dropdowns to add functionalities and the documentation tab.


## The documentation 


![logism documentation](https://github.com/ninja3011/logismtutorial/blob/gh-pages/ltut2.PNG)


- Click on help, click on tutorial.
- Core of Logism's documentation can be found here
- Unlike most software tools, the community documentation of logism isnt very strong. The inbuilt documentation provided here would be your regular go to.


## Creating a basic circuit ( taking the half adder circuit as an example)


![making a half adder circuit](https://github.com/ninja3011/logismtutorial/blob/gh-pages/halfadder.gif)
- The main purpose of this demonstration is to display how easy it is to get started with circuit design
- Here the sample circuit being created is a half adder circuit.
- It takes 2 inputs and gives outputs carry and sum. 
- A double combination of this circuit gives the ful adder which form the atoms of ALUs. 

## The Clock (Designing Sequential Circuits)

![counter](https://github.com/ninja3011/logismtutorial/blob/gh-pages/counter.gif)

- Most designs you make will have a sequential element to them
- To create time dependant chips, we need to know how to operate the clock element
- The orange circle near ports indicate, the bit length of gates/chips dont match.
  To make then match, we can manipulate the specs of the gate/chip on the bottom left of the screen.
- Once the circuit is designed we press Ctrl + K to start the run, the same can be used to close it as well


With this, you are ready to start developing your own circuits!
