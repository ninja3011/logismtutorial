# Getting Started with Logism 

Logism is a simulation environment that can be used by students to get the hang of circuit design. 
It's simplicity helps you get the hang of the stuff very quick
At the same time, when you reach more advanced circuits, constrainsts of logism start popping up.

## Why to learn logism

It is the least inertial method of circuit design. You can start designing beautiful circuits from day 1. Without worrying about chip names, which manufacturer, or any of the complex stuff. 

## Installation Link

[download logism for windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/)

## The first screen that opens

![empty logism screen](https://github.com/ninja3011/logismtutorial/blob/gh-pages/ltut1.PNG)

- On the left, a tab holds all the parts available to create a circuit in logism.
- On the right, there is an empty workspace to work with. You can drag and drop components here
- On the the top are dropdowns to add functionalities and the documentation tab.

## The documentation 

![logism documentation]()

-Click on help, click on tutorial.
-Core of Logism's documentation can be found here.
-Unlike most software tools, the community documentation of logism isnt very strong. The inbuilt documentation provided here would be your regular go to.
